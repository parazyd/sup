sup - scale user privileges
===========================
sup is a small tool for privilege escalation that allows normal users
to run other programs as a different user and group.


Configuration
-------------
Use the config.h file to apply authorizations that you want to allow in
sup. After editing, make sure to recompile and reinstall.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup and execute `make install` as
root. By default, sup will be installed into the /usr/local namespace.
