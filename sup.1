.SH DESCRIPTION
sup is a minimal privilege escalation utility that allows normal users
to run other programs as different user and group. It is "secured" by
hardcoding SHA256 sums of the executables into itself to decide if a
user is actually authorized to run the requested command. The way sup
works is that it is installed as a setuid binary and is statically
linked to avoid any possible LD_PRELOAD trickery.
.TP
The configuration is done in config.h at compile time.
